# LearnCpp
Relearning C++ (After Oracle wants money for Java this may be a wise choice)

I first learned C++, but then used Java for almost 20 years, because of the demand in industry.
There are some very nice features and aspects in Java which I would miss if I would entirely use C++.
But there are alternatives and I will list them here:

- Injection https://github.com/google/fruit/wiki
- REST Api https://github.com/oktal/pistache
- Hibernate / JPA (there are no real alternatives) https://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/

Switching (hypothetically) from Java to C++ is like switching from C++ to Basic and expect the features of one language also in the other, which is unrealistic.

There is the language D, which tries to combine both worlds of Java and C++, like C++ with Garbage Collector. But if you even fail to make a simple Hello World run, because of missing DLLs in the Windows installation of the D-compiler, then you will just begin to question if this language is mature enough.
